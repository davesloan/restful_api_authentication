# Change History / Release Notes

## Version 0.4.0
* Updated to support Rails 5.

## Version 0.3.0
* Added an is_disabled flag to the RestClient model. This allows clients to be disabled without deleting them from the database, so their credentials remain if you ever want to enable them in the future.

## Version 0.2.2
* Closed Issue #5 - Improperly formatted timestamps result in an uncaught exception

## Version 0.2.1

* Closed Issue #3 - Failing to define an environment in the YML causes a fatal error
* Closed Issue #4 - Changes to the request_window in the YML were ignored in favor of the default 4 minute window

## Version 0.2.0

* Added verbose error messaging; if this is enabled in the YML config file, then the response to an authentication failure will be more descriptive as to why the authentication failed. To enable, add `verbose_errors: true` to the `config/restful_api_authentication.yml`.

## Version 0.1.2

* Added some documentation on how to use the master authentication.
* Updated change history / release notes.

## Version 0.1.1
